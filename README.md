## :package: List of Projects

### **1st year**

- ##### 1st semester

  - [Dynamic Systems Introduction](/2ºano/1ºSemestre/DSS):
    All exercises and testes (2019/20).

- ##### 2nd semester

  - [Program Calculation](/2ºano/2ºSemestre/CP):
    This project follows program design by calculation methods with literate
    programming principles using Haskell and `lhs2TeX`.

  - [Software Labs III](/2ºano/2ºSemestre/LI3):
    This project is a modular Sales Management System done twice in C and JAVA.
    
  - [Object Oriented Programming](/2ºano/2ºSemestre/POO):
    This project is a Command Line Application for a delivery system built in the JAVA
    programming language using abstraction and reflections to automatically generate the app user interface (View) from the Model. 
    
  - [Operating System](/2ºano/2ºSemestre/SO):
    All exercises and project build in C to `Control, Communicate, and Monitor of Processes`.
    
### **3rd year**

- ##### 1st semester
   
  - [Software Development Systems](/3ºano/1ºSemestre/DSS/):
    This project is a Warehouse Managment System in Java, with a beautiful GUI in JavaFX, capable of managing an robot automated warehouse with multiple different  users at the same time - using an     online database. Additionally we built a Web Page capable of requesting Orders to the warehouse coded in JavaScript. Like in previous Java projects we made a terminal shell (now its used more as a development tool to quickly test queries and debug) that is generated automatically from the model source code using abstraction and reflextions.
